# My RSS Feeds
----

Hello, welcome to my RSS feeds repo.

I'm a old school guy and I heavily use RSS readers to keep up to date with hundreds of blog sources. 

Today my main feed reader is Feedly.

Here you will find my RSS OPM files from the sources I use.

Feel free to send a PR or open a issue with your suggestion.

I'm slowly adding more and more OPML files here. Stay tunned!
